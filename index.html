                        <p>In a land far far away there was a glorious kingdom. In the kingdom stood a great castle. And
                            inside the castle lived a handsome Prince.</p>
                        <p><img src="./resources/img/PRINCESS-_-PEA-1-1-1.gif" /></p>
                        <p>The Prince was sad.</p>
                        <p>He longed for a true Princess to share his castle and kingdom, but he could not find one.</p>
                        <p>This was not because there was a lack of Princesses. In fact, the kingdom was full of fair
                            maidens all claiming to be Princesses.</p>
                        <p>The Prince scoured the kingdom, meeting every one of these so-called Princesses. But he
                            returned sad and empty handed.</p>
                        <p>'It is impossible to tell whether these are true Princesses!' he said to his Father, the
                            King.</p>
                        <p>'You must be patient my son. You will know when you know.' said the King, with a knowing
                            smile.</p>
                        <p>The Prince smiled back, then went to his chamber.</p>

                        <p>That evening a huge storm came.</p>
                        <p>Thunder clapped. Lightning flashed. And the rain clattered down on the castle roof like the sound of a thousand horses charging into battle.</p>
                        <p>Suddenly, came a loud knock at the castle door. The King put on his robe and opened the door to find a cold, soggy young lady standing in front of him.</p>
                        <p><img src="./resources/img/PRINCESS-_-PEA-2-1-1.gif" /></p>
                        <p>'I am a true Princess,' she said, 'Please can I have some dry clothes and a bed for the night?'</p>
                        <p>The King let her in.</p>
                        <p>'She says she is a true Princess,' said the King to the old Queen-mother.</p>
                        <p>The Queen-mother didn’t say a word.</p>
                        <p>Instead, she thought to herself, 'we'll soon see about that'. She then handed the Princess a nightgown and said, 'put this on while I prepare your chamber'.</p>

                        <p>The Queen-mother began preparing the chamber—but in a very peculiar way.</p>
                        <p>First, she took the covers, sheets and mattress off the bed.</p>
                        <p>Then she placed a single garden pea on the bedstead.</p>
                        <p>And then she laid twenty mattresses on top of the pea taking care to separate each layer with a soft eiderdown quilt.</p>
                        <p>After this she replaced the bedclothes on the top mattress and said to the Princess, 'your chamber is ready!'</p>
                        <p><img src="./resources/img/PRINCESS-_-PEA-3-1-1.gif" /></p>
                        <p>The bed was now so high off the ground that the Princess needed to climb a ladder to get into the bed. The Princess climbed the ladder, got under the covers—extremely thankful for having been taking in for the night.</p>
